"""
Path handling classes and utility functions for ReMake.

This module defines classes to represent different types of paths and dependencies
within the ReMake build system:
- `VirtualTarget`: Represents a target that is not a physical file on the filesystem.
- `VirtualDep`: Represents a dependency that is not a physical file.
- `GlobPattern`: Represents a glob pattern used in pattern rules.

It also provides the `shouldRebuild` function to determine if a target needs to be
rebuilt based on its dependencies.
